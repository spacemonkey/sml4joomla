bq. Welcome to the SML Libraries for Joomla! project. Everyone is welcome, if you have anything you'd like to share please feel free to fork me and show me you love me.

h2. Wha?

This is a collection of helper libraries that provide just a tiny little comfort to the active Joomla! developer. Currently the sml4joomla libraries are for the "J!1.5 series":http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/frs/?action=FrsReleaseBrowse&frs_package_id=5241, however when time permits, they will be refactored to support any new goodness found in that release.

Most importantly, this isn't "the Joomla! project":http://www.joomla.org/, this is not official, this could very well be a figment of my fragile eggshell mind. Use with caution.

First up are two main helpers:

* JMongo - Nice little wrapper to the MongoDB PHP extension
* JRestRequest - Simple class for dealing with RESTful interfaces

There's also a sample config file (smlconfig.php) used for any stored configuration required by any of the libraries. At present this is just needed for MongoDB but may grow in the future.

h2. Instructions

Download this _sml_ folder and plop it in your _libraries_ folder at your Joomla! site's docroot. You are now free to load these libraries and use them in your extensions. Tutorials and documentation in the wiki are on the way.
